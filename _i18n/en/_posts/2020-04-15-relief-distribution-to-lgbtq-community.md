Hearty Thanks !!!

Yesterday and today, rights activist Sudeep Gautam has assisted in the distribution of relief to the LBGTQ+ community by providing relief materials to their dwelling place during this crisis time of Corona pandemic. The entire coordination and management of the relief material was done by Ranju Darshan, Day Lal Pradhan, Prakash Lama, Andrea Drewer, Claire and others.

Thanks to Ranju Darshan and Sudeep Gautam for their time in relief management during the day without emergency. Thank you also to Andrea Drewer for providing the reusable sanitary pad. Due to the constraints of relief materials, I had to meet Darsu Darshan for coordinating some of my other friends in need of relief. Many thanks to Unity for Change members Susan Danuwar, Rubina Tamang, and other colleagues who supported their work. Thanks also to FSGMN for supporting the documentation.
